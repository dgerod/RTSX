This is an official page for RTSX (Robotics Tools for Scilab/Xcos), an open-source software written in Scilab to support robot analysis and control courses. The toolset is inspired by Robotic Toolbox for MATLAB/Simulink by P.I.Corke [http://petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html] and share a similar set of core commands and functionality, though there are also differences in certain parts of the software.
